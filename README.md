# Amzon price tracker webscraping

A python script to automate the process of tracking price drops on Amazon. When the script detects a price drop, it notifies via given email.



In this project we made a simple web scraping tool using Beautiful soup and Python Request library. Which regularly checks the price of an item and when the price does go down it send an Email to the user alerting them that the price has decreased.

### This is a great project and I learnt a lot through this
